# Installation Instructions

## Scratch Org / Sandbox

## Unlocked Package Installation

Follow this set of instructions if you want to deploy the app to a more permanent environment than a Scratch org or if you don't want to install the local developement tools. You can use a non source-tracked orgs such as a free [Developer Edition Org](https://developer.salesforce.com/signup) or a [Trailhead Playground](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/).
Make sure to start from a brand-new environment to avoid conflicts with previous work you may have done.
