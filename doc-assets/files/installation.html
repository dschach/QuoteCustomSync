	Follow this set of instructions if you want to deploy the app to a more permanent environment than a Scratch org or if you don&#39;t want to install
	the local developement tools. You can use a non source-tracked orgs such as a free
	<a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/signup">Developer Edition Org</a> or a
	<a href="https://trailhead.salesforce.com/">Trailhead Playground</a>. Make sure to start from a brand-new environment to avoid conflicts with
	previous work you may have done.
